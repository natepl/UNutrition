# UNutrition App

> This is the main project front-end project
## Check out the backend [HERE](https://github.com/natepl/HackUMass).

### Description
Welcome to our cooler contribution to HackUmass XII! On this page is all of the work we've done to build a seamless user experience that can suggest potential healthy and sustainable meal options in UMass Dining Halls. It can also suggest meals based on user-defined goals or preferences (e.g. calorie deficit, low sugar). 

If you'd rather not think too hard about what you want to eat at Woo, don't worry, use UNutrition!


### Installation
Given that UNutrition is primarily built with Swift, the finished product would be found on the appstore. But, this app can be demoed with xcode.
